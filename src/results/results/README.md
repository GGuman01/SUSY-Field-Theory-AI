The paper introduces a supersymmetry (SUSY)-inspired framework to address one of the most fundamental challenges in AI: balancing generalization and robustness in neural networks. By leveraging principles from quantum field theory, the framework harmonizes these two objectives through a new kind of loss function. In traditional AI models, improving generalization (the ability to handle unseen data) can lead to reduced robustness (the ability to withstand adversarial attacks) and vice versa. This paper draws inspiration from supersymmetry (SUSY) in physics, where bosonic (force-mediating) and fermionic (matter-forming) components cancel each other out, resulting in a more stable system.In the context of AI, we treat generalization as the "bosonic" component and robustness as the "fermionic" component. The paper introduces a SUSY-inspired loss function that ensures both objectives are balanced during the training process.  Bosonic Loss: Encourages smooth learning and generalization using cross-entropy loss. Fermionic Loss: Promotes robustness against adversarial attacks using KL-divergence. SUSY-Inspired Loss Function: Combines these two loss components using a dynamic balancing parameter that cancels out adversarial noise while maintaining accuracy. Additionally, the model integrates parallel transport principles from differential geometry to stabilize weight updates across complex, non-Euclidean loss landscapes. The framework was validated using the CIFAR-10 dataset, a well-known image classification benchmark. The model was trained using the SUSY-inspired loss function and evaluated under adversarial attacks using Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). Stable Convergence: The model achieved smooth convergence during training, with loss values decreasing steadily across epochs. Robustness: The model demonstrated improved resilience to adversarial attacks, showing higher accuracy when tested against FGSM and PGD perturbations compared to standard models.
